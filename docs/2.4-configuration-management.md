Even though our Product Catalog service currently uses an in-memory data store,
it's important to understand how to manage configuration in a Kubernetes environment
for future needs and for other services we'll build.

Kubernetes offers several ways to manage configuration for your applications:

- **Environment Variables**: The simplest way to provide configuration. You can
  set environment variables directly in your Deployment manifest.
- **ConfigMaps**: Kubernetes ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration
  artifacts from your container images to make your applications easily
  configurable. They can store configuration data as key-value pairs or as
  entire configuration files.
- **Secrets**: Similar to ConfigMaps but designed to store sensitive information
  like passwords, API keys, and certificates securely. Secrets are stored in
  etcd (Kubernetes' backing store) and can be mounted as volumes or exposed as
  environment variables.

For now, we will be handling things using `configMaps` as it suits our current
use-case. But later we will touch upon other configuration tools.

1. Using Environment Variables

You already saw the `env` section in our `deployment.yaml`. We can directly set
environment variables there like:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: product-catalog
      image: your-dockerhub-username/product-catalog:<version>
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      env:
        - name: SERVICE_PORT
          value: "8080"
        - name: LOG_LEVEL
          value: "INFO"
        # We might use this later for database connection details
        # - name: DATABASE_URL
        #   value: "your_database_url"
```

The Go application can then read these environment variables using the `os`
package.

```go
import "os"

func main() {
    port := os.Getenv("SERVICE_PORT")
    if port == "" {
        port = "8080" // Default value
    }
    logLevel := os.Getenv("LOG_LEVEL")
    if logLevel == "" {
        logLevel = "INFO" // Default value
    }
    log.Printf("Service listening on port %s with log level %s", port, logLevel)
    // ... rest of application setup ...
}
```

Advantages of Environment Variables:

- Simple to implement and understand.
- Widely supported across different languages and frameworks.

Disadvantages of Environment Variables:

- Can become cumbersome for large amounts of configuration.
- Managing complex configurations or files can be difficult.
- Not ideal for sensitive information (use Secrets for that).

2. Using ConfigMaps

`ConfigMaps` provide a more structured way to manage configuration.

### Creating a ConfigMap

A ConfigMap can be defined in a YAML file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: product-catalog-config
data:
  service_port: "8080"
  log_level: "DEBUG"
  # You could also store entire files as key-value pairs
  # my_config_file.yaml: |
  #   key1: value1
  #   key2: value2
```
